# Study Buddy Finder

Study Buddy Finder is the Spring 2023 project of Team Redstone for UC Davis's Google Developers Student Club. It is a web application designed to help students find study partners for their current classes. The application allows users to input their course schedule, preferred meeting times and locations, and courses they require assistance in. Additionally, users can message prospective study partners, schedule study sessions, add them to their Google Calendar, and host group chats with potential study partners.
